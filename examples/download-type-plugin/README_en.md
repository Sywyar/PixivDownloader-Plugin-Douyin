# Download type plugin template

This standalone Maven project demonstrates a stable, resilient, and approachable PixivDownloader Plugin API surface for a new download type. It is intentionally deterministic: the endpoints produce mock items, the queue is in memory, and no external website, credential, proxy, database, or download directory is used.

> **Execution trust warning:** this template requires a Spring child context and behavioral capabilities, so its descriptor is `host-process-full-trust` with `process-restart`. A third-party package can use this full-capability path in production after package verification and explicit administrator trust confirmation; a signature proves publisher identity and content integrity, not safety. Do not change the descriptor to `declarative-process` while retaining configuration classes, controllers, queues, schedules, or other in-process behavior.

Before publishing a real plugin, replace these identities consistently:

| Template value | Replace with |
|---|---|
| `example-download-plugin` | Your Maven artifact id |
| `example-download` | Globally unique plugin and queue type id |
| `com.example.pixivdownload.downloadtype` | Your Java package |
| `ExampleDownload*` | Your Java class prefix |
| `0.1.0` | Your plugin artifact version |
| `plugin.requires=1.0` | The compatible PixivDownloader SDK major/minor requirement |
| `plugin.provider=Example Developer` | Your provider name |
| `example-download` i18n namespace | Your unique web i18n namespace |
| `/api/example-download/**` and `/example-download/**` | Plugin-owned API and static paths |

Build with JDK 17, Maven and Node.js using `mvn clean verify`, or build both repository templates with `mvn -f ../pom.xml clean verify`. The POM declares one `pixivdownload-sdk` dependency with `provided` scope, plus JUnit for tests. The SDK supplies public contracts, PF4J, Spring, Servlet and Jackson transitively. The output remains a thin PF4J JAR without copies of those libraries. The configured candidate SDK version must be available in your Maven repository.

The verified `pixiv.kind`, `pixiv.configuration-classes`, `pixiv.execution-mode`, and `pixiv.lifecycle-policy` entries in `plugin.properties` are authoritative at runtime. Keep the compatibility `configurationClasses()` result aligned with the descriptor for older hosts and SDK tooling.

## Stable examples included

Keep `.pixivdownloader-plugin-project` in the selected project directory and track it with Git. Generated markers contain `pixivdownloader-plugin-project-v1` followed by LF; readers also accept a UTF-8 BOM and no line ending or CRLF. The marker identifies the project format and proves neither publisher identity nor code safety. It stays out of the plugin JAR.

The package declares `pixiv.risk-signals=HOST_DATA_ACCESS` because its controller and scheduled executors consume host-provided identity and task contexts. The example does not download remote content or write artwork files. Update the declaration when adding behavior. Declarations describe capabilities; they do not grant permissions or establish that a plugin is safe.

- PF4J entry point, `PixivPluginProvider`, `PixivFeaturePlugin`, and explicit Spring child-context configuration.
- `DownloadTypeDescriptor` contract version 1 with all five acquisition modes, explicit single-item cancellation support, filters, settings, and a required behavior-module URL. UI slots are published separately so their module ownership cannot drift from the host-stamped contribution.
- `QueueOperations` with clear-all, owner-scoped clear, optional opaque-string `workKey` cancel, and the default already-drained quiesce sentinel. Queue items keep the raw key in top-level `cancelWorkKey`; the host posts it as JSON to the queue-type endpoint, so it is distinct from the card/display id and is not restricted to one URL path segment. The default drain is correct only because this mock performs no background work; an asynchronous implementation must return and drain a real positive generation.
- A controller that obtains `RequestOwnerIdentity` only from the host-provided `RequestOwnerIdentityResolver`; request bodies and query parameters never choose their own owner.
- A current-script-scoped queue behavior module with `process(item)`, import, user, series, search, quick, filters, settings, and a declarative settings slot. `process` writes only through `context.updateItem`, and quick actions publish results through `context.publishWorks`; plugins do not receive queue persistence or rendering globals.
- A separate UI-slot module that mounts a Vue component through the host `PixivVue` helper and uses owner-scoped `supports` / `dispatchQuickAction`. Do not bundle Vue in a plugin.
- A credential-free schedule source and synchronous work executor using only stable contracts. Its browser hooks read and restore the current single-import value through publication-scoped `context.acquisitionInput(mode)` / `context.restoreAcquisition(mode, value)`; they do not read host DOM ids or call host globals.
- An admin-only independent gallery page rendered with DOM APIs, i18n bundles, separate HTML/CSS/JS files, and dark-mode variables.
- Deterministic controller endpoints returning stable machine codes plus i18n keys.

## Deliberate limits

This template is not a network downloader and does not demonstrate authentication, anti-bot workarounds, DRM access, private content, host database access, or a host download-root service. Replace the in-memory domain action with your own lawful blocking download implementation before reporting `ScheduledWorkResult.completed()`.

This template exposes a plugin-owned gallery page by contributing its own routes, static resources, controller, i18n bundle, and `gallery.type-switch` navigation entry. PixivDownloader has no generic gallery API or shared gallery runtime: every download-type plugin owns its gallery data, rendering, media serving, filters, and actions. Do not mount third-party code into `/pixiv-gallery.html`, call another plugin's gallery API, or import gallery, app, runtime-internal, installer, or signature-internal classes to bypass that boundary.

The schedule contracts are stable, but the host remains responsible for claims, leases, credentials, cancellation, pending work, and checkpoints. A plugin owns only its descriptor, opaque definition/payload schemas, source discovery, and synchronous work execution. The current neutral browser input adapter exposed to third-party source modules covers `single-import`; do not reach into host DOM or private mode functions to emulate other editor modes. This example is credential-free and has no checkpoint.

The queue cancel contract is addressed by `(queueType, workKey)`. `workKey` is an opaque stable string within that queue type; validate it only inside your own implementation. The host bridge calls `POST /api/download/queue/{queueType}/cancel` with JSON containing the raw `workKey` plus the backend manifest's `pluginId`, `packageId`, `generation`, and descriptor `publicationId`. Those fields prove descriptor currentness; they are not the user's authorization identity. The server fixes the matching operation proxy before rechecking that descriptor publication and fails closed if either publication changes. User owner/admin scope is derived separately from the current request. Plugin modules should use the host cancel bridge instead of constructing this control request themselves. Never broadcast a key to every queue type, coerce every site identity to a number, place the key in a path segment, or accept a user owner UUID supplied by caller JSON.
