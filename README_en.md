# PixivDownloader Plugin SDK 1.0.0-rc6

[简体中文](README.md)

The extracted root is a standalone Maven project with sources in `src/`. Its SDK identity is `sdk-api-v1.0.0-rc6`, built from main-repository commit `e288be8797874783db44aa6fa1819cf8d48ab03c`. Open `docs/javadocs/index.html` for the API reference.

The package includes `.git/` with an initial commit on `main` containing all delivered files. Use `git status` and `git diff` to review your changes. Configure your Git name and email before committing your work, and add a remote when you need one. The `.gitignore` excludes build output, local IDE settings, and `.dev/` runtime data.

## Start developing

The root Maven project and each of the three `examples/` projects contain a Git-tracked `.pixivdownloader-plugin-project`. It identifies the selected project's format and proves neither identity nor safety; `sdk-project.json` separately pins the development environment. Plugin JARs, `.dev/`, and runtime archives do not contain the project marker.

Declare capabilities with comma-separated tokens in the package's `plugin.properties` field `pixiv.risk-signals`. The root, Gradle, and sbt examples use an explicit empty declaration. The download example declares `HOST_DATA_ACCESS` for its host-provided identity and task contexts. Update the declaration when adding behavior. Missing or empty declarations and scans with no findings are not safety guarantees or permission grants.

Install JDK 17 and Node.js, with `java` and `node` on `PATH`. IDE import only resolves the project. Explicit Run / Debug compiles the current plugin, prepares the pinned runtime, and starts the full application. Build failure stops this sequence. Maven Wrapper obtains the pinned Maven version; no host checkout or manually copied host and plugin JARs are needed. Initial application configuration uses the host's setup flow.

| IDE | Import | Run | Debug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IntelliJ IDEA | Open the root `pom.xml` | Select `Developer Mode` and click Run | Select the same `Developer Mode` and click Debug |
| VS Code | Open this directory and install the recommended Java Extension Pack | `Tasks: Run Task > Run Plugin` | `Run and Debug > Debug Plugin` |
| Eclipse | `Import > Existing Maven Projects` | `eclipse/Run Plugin.launch` | `eclipse/Debug Plugin.launch` group |

IntelliJ's `Developer Mode` is a native Application configuration. Before launch, Maven runs `test-compile exec:exec@sdk-prepare`. The IDE starts the JVM directly, running the host, bundled official plugins, and the current project's `target/classes` in that process. Set a breakpoint inside `ExampleMinimalPlugin.java`'s `routes()` and click Debug. No remote connection or fixed debug port is needed. The entry point in `src/test/java/sdk/DevelopmentLauncher.java` stays out of the plugin JAR. The run configuration adds the bundled tool to the launch classpath so Spring Boot can resolve nested JARs.

This configuration explicitly enables plugin development mode. Current sources execute as `host-process-full-trust`, which the runtime status reports; the source descriptor stays unchanged. Each Run / Debug recompiles and loads the sources. Use `Stop Plugin` or stop the Application session to finish.

VS Code, Eclipse, and the command-line tasks below validate the packaged artifact: they install the current JAR and preserve its declared execution mode. Their remote debugger uses `127.0.0.1:5005` by default, connecting to the worker for `declarative-process` or the host for `host-process-full-trust`. Use `Stop Plugin` or stop the entire group to finish; disconnecting only the remote debugger leaves the application running.

## Command line

Windows:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd verify exec:exec@sdk-run
.\mvnw.cmd verify exec:exec@sdk-debug
.\mvnw.cmd exec:exec@sdk-stop
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
sh ./mvnw verify exec:exec@sdk-run
sh ./mvnw verify exec:exec@sdk-debug
sh ./mvnw exec:exec@sdk-stop
```

`sdk-debug` waits for an IDE to attach; it does not open a debugger. Use `clean verify` to validate the plugin, or `exec:exec@sdk-prepare` to prepare only the runtime. The default artifact is `target/example-minimal-plugin-0.1.0.jar`.

After successfully building the current artifact, you can call the bundled tool directly:

```text
java -jar tools/sdk-tools.jar run <absolute-project-path> <absolute-current-plugin-JAR> --no-gui
java -jar tools/sdk-tools.jar debug <absolute-project-path> <absolute-current-plugin-JAR> --debug-port=5005
java -jar tools/sdk-tools.jar stop <absolute-project-path>
```

`--debug-connect` connects to an IDE already listening. `run` / `debug` accept artifacts inside the project and outside `.dev/`, preserving their declared execution mode and confirming the current JAR's SHA-256 for local installation. Official plugins retain signature and provenance checks during both development and packaged validation. Choose a unique plugin ID to avoid conflicts with bundled plugins.

## Independent examples

| Directory | Purpose | Run / debug / stop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `examples/download-type-plugin/` | Download types, queues, scheduled sources, and a plugin-owned gallery | From the SDK root: `mvnw -f examples/download-type-plugin/pom.xml verify exec:exec@sdk-run`; use `sdk-debug` to debug, or only `exec:exec@sdk-stop` to stop |
| `examples/gradle-plugin/` | Build the basic feature plugin with Gradle | In that directory: `gradlew runPlugin`, `gradlew debugPlugin`, `gradlew stopPlugin` |
| `examples/sbt-plugin/` | Build the same feature plugin with sbt | Install sbt, then run `sbt runPlugin` or `sbt debugPlugin` in that directory; stop from another terminal with `java -jar ../../tools/sdk-tools.jar stop .` |

Use `mvnw.cmd` / `gradlew.bat` on Windows, or `sh ./mvnw` / `sh ./gradlew` on Linux / macOS. Import each example separately. Each owns its `sdk-project.json` and `.dev/`, and uses the root `tools/sdk-tools.jar`. Gradle Wrapper pins 9.5.0; the sbt project pins 1.10.11. Gradle / sbt examples compile, package, and check JavaScript syntax. Maven projects also include JUnit and thin JAR checks.

## One SDK dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.sywyar.pixivdownloader</groupId>
    <artifactId>pixivdownload-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-rc6</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Gradle uses `compileOnly("io.github.sywyar.pixivdownloader:pixivdownload-sdk:1.0.0-rc6")`. sbt uses `"io.github.sywyar.pixivdownloader" % "pixivdownload-sdk" % "1.0.0-rc6" % Provided`. Standard Ivy can map its compile configuration:

```xml
<dependency org="io.github.sywyar.pixivdownloader" name="pixivdownload-sdk"
            rev="1.0.0-rc6" conf="compile->default"/>
```

Do not make Ivy's runtime configuration extend this compile configuration. Standard Maven metadata supplies public APIs and PF4J, Spring, Servlet, and Jackson compile dependencies. Produce a thin PF4J JAR without bundling these host-provided classes. Declare test frameworks separately. The three API modules and BOM remain individually available.

## Community formats and resources

`contracts/community/v1/` contains the community JSON Schema, capability tokens, market categories and tags, license templates, and signature and data validation vectors. Consult `catalogs.json` when filling in `pixiv.risk-signals`. Choose a license template that fits your project; license declarations are not restricted to the template list.

`bundle-manifest.json` records each resource's size and SHA-256, along with tool versions. `tools/community-contract.json` records the SDK, source commit, contract version, resource manifest hash, and the size and hash of this `sdk-tools.jar`. Pin the complete release and its hashes when consuming these resources. Update tools and resources from the same release instead of replacing individual catalog files. These files belong to the development package's initial Git commit and stay out of plugin JARs and public Maven compile dependencies.

## Runtime, cache, and project data

`sdk-project.json` and the release-side `sdk-release.json` record the same SDK, host, official plugin manifest, and runtime ZIP identities, sizes, and SHA-256 hashes. The runtime ZIP is a separate SDK Release attachment. Explicit preparation downloads it once and reuses verified bytes in `~/.cache/pixivdownloader-sdk/`. Clearing the cache still selects the same bytes. Unavailable resources and hash mismatches fail.

Every launch creates a private runtime copy and checks the host and each official plugin. The cache holds no application state. Project `.dev/` contains configuration, databases, logs, downloads, and run copies. Configuration and state are separated by runtime ZIP hash. Host and official plugin automatic updates are disabled in this environment; your regular installation's data is separate.

After stopping, delete the project's `.dev/` to reset development data, including downloads stored there. Direct tool calls can select a cache with the JVM property `-Dpixivdownload.sdk.cache-dir=<directory>`; project runtime directories remain separate.

Offline use requires both runtime preparation and cached build-tool dependencies. Maven uses `-o`; Gradle uses `--offline`. Incomplete caches fail. To update the SDK, use the new development package and matching manifest, then move your sources into it.

On Windows, IntelliJ Application launch and source breakpoints have been tested, along with startup, pages, and normal shutdown for both Maven examples in the host process. The VS Code and Eclipse GUI flows have not been tested. During packaged validation, deep directories can still exceed Windows' working-directory limit when creating a worker; move to a shorter path if error 267 occurs. Other platforms declared by the runtime require verification on their own operating systems.

## Customize the plugin

The descriptor is `src/main/resources/plugin.properties`. Keep the plugin ID, Java package, routes, i18n namespace, version, and provider consistent. Maven runtime tasks use the actual `finalName`. Update the Eclipse configurations' project name if you rename the imported project.

Stable contracts cover routes, static assets, i18n, navigation, Web UI slots, GUI configuration, download types, queues, scheduled sources, and notification templates. `examples/download-type-plugin/README_en.md` explains the five acquisition modes, cancellation and drain, credential policy, guards, and `gallery.type-switch`. Each plugin owns its gallery pages, APIs, assets, and data operations.

Declare configuration through `GuiConfigContribution`. Use owner-bound `RuntimePathProvider` paths, `PluginDataSource` for private databases, and stable HTTP / WebSocket factories and route contracts. Do not depend on the app, plugin-runtime, installer, signature internals, host database, or concrete GUI provider. Verify contribution withdrawal on disable, unload, and reload in a real host.
